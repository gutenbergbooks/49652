<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a time when there
was no Christmas at all. There were
no beautiful Christmas trees and happy
songs and stockings filled with presents.
No one shouted “Merry Christmas!” or
“Christmas Gift!” No one told the sweet
story of Jesus, because Jesus had not come
into the world and so
there was no Christmas.
You see Christmas
is Jesus’ birthday,
and before he
came, of course people
could not keep
his birthday. You have heard of how wicked
and unhappy the people were long ago.
Although God loved them and tried to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
them do right, they forgot about him and did
so many naughty, disobedient things that
they were very miserable. Then God sent
a wonderful message to them. He told them
that some day he would send them his own
Son, who should be their King and teach
them how to do right. He said that his Son
would come as a little child to grow up
among them to love and help them. God
even told them what they should call this
baby who was to
be their King.
God said that
Christ would be
like a beautiful
light showing
them where to go.
It would be as
though some people
stumbling sorrowfully along a dark
street should suddenly see a bright light
shining ahead of them, making everything
cheerful and pleasant. They would be joyful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
like people who gather in the harvest.
Jesus makes his children happy, and he
wants them to shine out and make others
happy. These people who were so unhappy
before Jesus came, were very glad to know
that some day he would come. They talked
about him and waited a long, long time before
he came and brought Christmas light
into the world.</p>

<h2>The Coming of Jesus.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">LONG ago there lived a good man named
Joseph, a carpenter of Nazareth, who
built houses and made many useful things
for people. He also loved to read God’s
Gift Book, and tried to obey its rules. One
day the king of the land where Joseph lived
ordered everyone to write his name in a
book, and pay a tax, in his own city. So
Joseph and Mary his wife got ready to take
a long journey to their old home, Bethlehem.
There were no cars for them to ride in, so
they must either walk or ride a donkey. As
the fashion was there, Mary wore a long,
white veil which covered her beautiful face.</p>

<p>The streets were full of people, walking, or
traveling on mules, donkeys, or camels—all
going to be taxed. It was winter, but in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
warm country, and they went through valleys
of figs, olives, dates, oranges and other
good things.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="175" height="207" alt="on the way to Bethlehem" />
</div>

<p>They must have been very tired when
they reached Bethlehem’s gates, for they
had come a long distance,
and the dust of the road,
the bustle of traveling,
and the strangeness of it
all, seemed to add to their
trials. The people of
Bethlehem had opened
their homes and welcomed
the strangers, until every house was full,
and still the people kept coming. They
could scarcely go up the steep hill, they were
so weary, and Joseph tried to get a place to
rest, but there was no kind invitation, no
welcome in any house for them, and the inns
were crowded. The inns were not like our
hotels for travelers; they were flat-roofed
stone buildings, without windows. There
were no warm rooms with carpets, and soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beds for tired travelers to lie on. There
were only bare floors, and everyone had to
bring his own bed and food. The courtyard
was full of animals—donkeys, mules, camels,
sheep and cows.</p>

<p>After Joseph had tried and failed to get
a resting place, as there was no room anywhere,
some kind friend told him of a cave
on the hillside which was used as a stable,
and to this they gladly went. Sweet-smelling
hay was all around, and the floor was
covered with straw; possibly mild-eyed cows
and gentle sheep were sleeping in their
stalls. Along the walls were mangers, or
boxes to hold the grain and hay when the
animals were fed. Here Mary and Joseph
found a shelter and a sleeping place; indeed,
they were thankful to be led there to rest
upon the hay. In the night a wonderful
thing took place: God sent the baby Gift
Child into the world. This gift had been
promised long before to Adam and Eve, and
now it had come—the most beautiful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dearest Baby ever held in a mother’s arms.
The night grew dark, the house-lights went
out one by one, and the people in Bethlehem
slept.</p>

<h2>The Angels’ Joy.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE happiest song that was ever sung
was sung on the first and best Christmas
of all. There was a time when there
was no Christmas. Can you think how
glad you would be if you had no Christmas,
and then one day all at once you had the
first and best one of all?</p>

<p>This song was sung and the first Christmas
came one night long years ago, far over
the sea, near a little town called Bethlehem.
It did not come first to kings and great people,
but to some shepherds who were sitting
up all night watching their sheep.</p>

<p>Outside of the city were beautiful sloping
green fields where the shepherds let their
sheep run about and eat the grass. The
weather there is very pleasant at Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
time; not at all like our weather. The
shepherds can sit out on the grass all night,
watching their sheep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="233" height="149" alt="more angels more shepherds" />
</div>

<p>Did you ever see a sheep or a lamb? Do
you know that your mittens and jackets and
nice warm dresses are made of the wool
which the sheep have to spare for us? The
shepherds have to stay out with the sheep
all night because
they are very gentle
and timid
animals. They
cannot fight for
themselves, and if
they were left
alone the wolves would catch them.</p>

<p>One night about 1900 years ago some
shepherds were watching their sheep in
those fields. Very likely the shepherds were
some of the people who were hoping that
Jesus would soon come; perhaps they were
talking about him, and wondering how they
would know if he did come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once a bright light shone about
them, and they saw an angel and heard him
speak to them. Very kind and beautiful
the angel looked, but the shepherds were
frightened.</p>

<p>The angel said to them, “Fear not; for
behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people; for unto
you is born this day in the city of David a
Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And
this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find
the babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying
in a manger.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="210" height="169" alt="heavenly host and angels" />
</div>

<p>As the angel was speaking, the shepherds
saw with him a great
number of beautiful,
shining angels. Then
was sung for the first
time this grand song,
for Christmas had
come. I do not know
the tune, but the very words are in the
Bible: “Glory to God in the highest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on earth peace, good-will toward men.”
Glory to God, for the greatest gift that
ever came; peace on earth, for all who love
this Savior.</p>

<p>As soon as the angels finished the song
they went back to heaven, and left the
shepherds alone.</p>

<h2>The Shepherds Visit Jesus.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHAT would you do if you had been
one of those shepherds to whom the
angels brought the good news of Jesus’ birth?
I will tell you what they did. They left their
sheep to take care of themselves, and hurried
off to Bethlehem, for that was the city
the angels meant.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 224px;">
<img src="images/illus23.jpg" width="224" height="166" alt="same picture as before but a drawing instead of painting" />
</div>

<p>They went in the
gate and at last
found the right place.
It was called a stable.</p>

<p>They soon found
the dear little baby
Jesus, just as the angels had said, lying in
a manger, and Mary his mother and Joseph
taking care of him.</p>

<p>The little manger was in the stable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there the shepherds stood beside it and
looked into the face of the babe.</p>

<p>Do you think the dear little baby had a
nice bed to lie in? It looked like a block
hollowed out. It was the box out of which
the cows ate.</p>

<p>It was warm and soft, because his mother
had put nice soft hay in it, and wrapped him
all up with a long strip of cloth. They were
in a stable because so many people were in
the city that there was not a bit of room
left. I think it must have been a clean
place, with lots of nice, sweet new hay.</p>

<p>When the shepherds saw the baby they
knew that he was really Jesus their Savior.
They knelt at his feet and worshiped him.
They were so happy that they could hardly
say what they felt. They soon went away
and told the good news to every one they
met. They were very glad because Jesus
had come. He came as a little baby so he
would know how to love and help all other
babies and little children, and be an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for them to follow as they grew older.</p>

<p>We are glad Jesus came, and we love to
keep his birthday, because he gives us joy
and peace, fills our hearts with love, and
helps us to be good and happy here and to
get ready to be happy in heaven.</p>

<p>God, our Father in heaven, sent to us
this wonderful Christmas Gift. Think of
the great love he must have for us, to give
us his Son. Think of the great love Jesus
had for us, that he could leave his beautiful
home in heaven to come and help us and
show us how to live. Let us thank him
every day for his great love. “For God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son” to be our Savior.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JOSEPH, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
stayed in Bethlehem for a while. When
Jesus was only eight days old he received
his name; he was called “Jesus,” as the
angel had told Mary.
It was the custom of
the Jews to take their
first son to the temple
and present him to
God, so Joseph and
Mary went to Jerusalem to present Jesus to
God in the temple.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="215" height="213" alt="holy family and Simeon once more" />
</div>

<p>At the time when Jesus was born, there
was an old man, named Simeon, living in
Jerusalem. He was a good man and was
looking and wishing for Jesus, the promised
Messiah, to come. God’s Holy Spirit had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
told him that he should not die until he
had seen Jesus. Simeon went up to the
temple to worship God every day. One day
while he was in the temple Mary and Joseph
brought the child to present him to God.
When Simeon saw
them he knew that
the infant in Mary’s
arms was his Savior.
He at once took Jesus
in his arms, and with
a heart full of joy he
blessed God and
said, “Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.” He
had seen the Savior for whom he looked,
and had nothing more to wish; he was perfectly
satisfied to die, now that he had seen
Jesus, the Savior of the world. When
Jesus comes into our hearts we are satisfied,
and not only ready to die, but we are ready
to live and do with glad hearts all that God
wishes us to do. The best way to praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
God for his wonderful gift is to <i>live for him</i>
and lead others to praise him.</p>

<p>God’s Spirit was upon Simeon, and he rejoiced
to see Jesus his Savior, whom God
had sent to his people. Do you wonder
that Simeon’s heart was full of joy at seeing
God’s greatest gift to man? Should
not we praise him for it?</p>

<p>At the time of Jesus’ birth, the world was
very dark and sinful. People did not know
much about God or what he wanted them
to do. In Jesus, Simeon saw a great Light
which would lighten the world.</p>

<p>Did you ever try to walk in a dark night
where there were no lights to shine on the
pathway? If so, you were sure to go the
wrong road, or to stumble and fall. While
you were walking in the darkness, did a
great electric light suddenly shine out,
making all light about you? So into the
dark lives of the people Jesus came to be a
Light. We are sure that Jesus is a Light
to us and to all the world. He lived a holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
life, so he made a right path for us to follow.
He showed us how to live and how to
die, so that we may live forever in heaven.
If we take his love into our hearts and do
as he tells us, we shall walk in the light.
Just as a railway locomotive runs in the
great light from the lamp that sends
its bright rays along the track, so Jesus
dwelling in our hearts shines his light just
where we are to travel—that is, he tells us
by his Spirit and by his Word how we are
to act and what we are to do.</p>


<p>While Mary and Joseph
and Jesus were
yet in the temple,
Anna, a prophetess,
came in and saw Jesus.
Then she, too, praised
the Lord because Jesus
had come to be a Light
to the world. She told
the people that Jesus was the Son of God
who had come into this world to live in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hearts and be our Light. Jesus in our
hearts is like a torchlight which we carry
with us always, and which never goes out,
but gives us light wherever we go. We
follow this light when we do the things that
Jesus taught us to do, and when we follow
the example that he left us.</p>

<h2>The Journey of the Wise Men.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE were some very rich, wise men
living away off in another country.
God wanted them to know about his Son.
He did not send angels to tell them; he took
another way. He put a strange new star
in the sky. These wise men spent a great
deal of time studying about stars, so when
they saw this they were very much interested
in it. When they saw strange stars
they thought strange things would happen.
They had heard that the Jews were looking
for Jesus to come and be their king, so they
thought this star must mean that he
had come. They thought very likely that
he had come to Jerusalem, for that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
great city of the Jews. So they started on
their long journey.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/illus34.jpg" width="247" height="147" alt="wise men on journey" />
</div>

<p>They traveled on until they reached Jerusalem.
Then
they went at once
to Herod the king
and asked him
where Jesus was
who was born
King of the Jews. Herod had not heard
that Jesus was born, and when he heard
this question he was troubled, for he was
not born king—he had been made king.
So he was very much afraid that Jesus, who
was born King, would take his place.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/illus35a.jpg" width="212" height="203" alt="wise following star" />
</div>

<p>He called in the Jews, who he thought
ought to know, and asked them to find out
where Jesus was to be born. They looked
in the Bible and found that he was to be
born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>When Herod heard this he told the wise
men to go to Bethlehem and look for Jesus,
and when they found him to bring him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
word so that he might go and worship him.
He wanted to kill Jesus, but he did not tell
the wise men so. They again started out,
and they were very much pleased to see the
same star still shining
in the sky.</p>


<p>This star went before
them to guide
them to Bethlehem.
They believed the
star would guide
them right, so they
followed it until it stood over a house in the
city.</p>

<h2>The Wise Men’s Gifts to Jesus.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the wise men went into the
house they found Jesus there with
Mary, his mother, and Joseph, her husband.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" width="229" height="186" alt="drawing of wise men's visit to house" />
</div>

<p>As soon as they
saw him they knew
it was Jesus, whom
they had come so
far to see. They
fell down before
him and worshiped
him. They
brought him rich gifts of gold, frankincense
and myrrh. These gifts of gold, frankincense
and myrrh were costly and useful;
they must have been of great help to Mary
and Joseph, who were very poor. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gifts from the wise men to Jesus showed
their love for him. Those who truly love
Jesus now will be glad to give of their
money to help the poor and needy, and to
teach those who do not know about him;
and what we do for his sake he counts as
done for him. But the greatest gift that
we can give Jesus is the gift of our hearts.</p>

<p>While they were there worshiping Jesus,
God was looking into the heart of Herod,
reading his wicked thoughts. He knew
that if the wise men went back and told
Herod where Jesus was, he would come and
kill him. So when the wise men were ready
to go away, God warned them in a dream to
go back another way and not to go near
Jerusalem, where they would meet Herod.
They believed God in this too, and did as
he told them to.</p>

<h2>The Flight into Egypt.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illus41.jpg" width="225" height="179" alt="drawing of journey to Egypt" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the wise men were gone, God sent
an angel to warn Joseph to take Jesus and
Mary, his mother, and leave Bethlehem.
He told him to take them to Egypt and
stay there until he told them they might
return. Why do
you suppose God
told Joseph to leave
their home? He
knew that Herod
wanted to kill
Jesus, and that it
would be dangerous
to stay there. If they went to Egypt
they would be safe, for Herod had no
power over Egypt. They would find friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
there too, for a great many Jews were
living in Egypt then.</p>

<p>Joseph loved God and believed him, so he
proved that he loved and believed him by
obeying at once. He did not wait until
morning, but at once arose, got ready, and
took Mary and Jesus and they started in
the night for Egypt. They did not go to
some other place instead. They went just
when God told them to go, and went just
where he told them to; and they were safe
while they followed God’s directions.</p>

<p>Jesus was soon safe in Egypt. Herod did
not know this, and was still making his
plans to kill him. He was a very wicked,
cruel man. He was wicked enough to kill
two of his own sons, so you see he did not
care much about killing a baby.</p>

<p>He did not know just how old Jesus was,
but thought he could not be over two
years old. He did not know where he lived,
for the wise men did not go back to tell
him. But he was bound to kill Jesus, so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
told his cruel soldiers to go into every
house in Bethlehem, even into the houses
near Bethlehem, and kill every boy baby
they could find two years old or less.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="181" height="202" alt="drawing of killing of the babies" />
</div>

<p>So they went around killing all the baby
boys. They would go into a house, snatch
the baby out of its crib, or
out of its mother’s arms,
and kill it right before
her eyes. That was a
sad time in Bethlehem;
for many poor mothers
were weeping for
their children. It was
very sad for the mothers,
but the little boys were safe in heaven
with God.</p>

<p>God was still watching over and taking
care of his Son; so when at last Herod was
dead, God again sent an angel to Joseph,
telling him to take Jesus and Mary and go
back to the land of Israel, or the land of
the Jews. So Joseph again set out on a journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
But he heard that Herod’s son was
king, and he was afraid to go back to Bethlehem,
so he went to Nazareth.</p>

<h2>Jesus in the Temple.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Jesus was a very little baby, his
mother took him to the temple, their
church, and gave him to the Lord. I suppose
they wrote down his name, as we do
our Cradle Roll babies. If they did, I think
we may call Jesus a Cradle Roll baby. I am
sure that Mary and Joseph did all they
could to help the baby to grow up a good,
wise, loving boy. The dear little babies
do not stay babies long; then their toys
go and they want books, for they must
learn a great deal before they are grown-up
men and women. So Jesus’ toys were soon
put away, and he began to study just as
you do. He grew bigger and stronger every
day. At last he was as big as you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
then bigger, until he was as big as your
brother or sister.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/illus48.jpg" width="284" height="194" alt="large group of people traveling including boy Jesus" />
</div>

<p>Do you know someone who is twelve
years old? At last Jesus got to be so old.
At that age a boy was no longer a Cradle
Roll baby, nor even a child. Jesus’ mother
said that
now he could
go with her
and Joseph
and their
friends when
they went up
to Jerusalem
to church.
Did you ever go on a journey? How did
you go? On the cars. Were you glad to
go? You got tired, I know. A picture of
Joseph and Mary and Jesus on their way to
Jerusalem would show you that they all
walked. It was a long, hard journey, for
they not only had to walk all the way, but
they had to carry all their bundles. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
went in a company, so they had a nice time
talking with their friends as they walked.
Then when tired or hungry, they would
stop by the way in the shade of some great
rocks—for in that land rocks are found
oftener than shade trees.</p>

<p>You can make a picture of this journey
in your mind. Think of the wall of the
city of Jerusalem and the open gate; inside
the wall is the church, or temple; there is a
road of sand, and on both sides of the road
are a few trees and a good many rocks.</p>

<p>At last they all reached the city, and
slept and rested and ate their food, then
bathed and dressed in their best clothes,
and went to the temple to worship God and
hear about his law out of the Bible.</p>

<p>All this was very wonderful and beautiful
to Jesus. He began to understand that
God was his Father, and that he had some
very great work to do in the world. He
was so interested that when it was time to
start for home he stayed after all the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
left, and went back to the temple. Perhaps
he had been allowed to go by himself
and did not know they had started home.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/illus50.jpg" width="217" height="164" alt="drawing of Jesus in temple" />
</div>

<p>Mary did not miss Jesus for some time.
She thought he was with his young friends
having a good time. At last she became
frightened, for she found that he was not
with any of these friends. Oh, how frightened
she was! Her beautiful boy that she
loved more than her own life, was lost! I
once knew of a very lovely boy who was lost
all night. How his mother cried, and how we
looked for him all night! In the morning
his mother was the
one to find him,
then her sorrow
was changed to joy.</p>

<p>Mary and Joseph
left their friends
and went back to
the city. In her heart Jesus’ mother
knew where to look for him. Can you
think where he was? They found him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the temple talking with the teachers. They
were talking about God’s law. They had
their books, reading and studying together.
These books were made of strips of parchment
or paper fastened at both ends to
round sticks and rolled up.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 199px;">
<img src="images/illus51.jpg" width="199" height="128" alt="drawing of Jesus' parents finding him in the temple" />
</div>

<p>When Jesus saw his mother and knew
how she had grieved
about him, he left the
teachers at once and
went back home with
her and Joseph. He
told them that he
knew God was his Father, and that he must
be about his work. But quickly and lovingly
he obeyed his mother and went with
her, even though he longed to stay.</p>

<p>Do you think Jesus was about his heavenly
Father’s business when he obeyed
Mary and Joseph and went home so lovingly
with them? He surely was, for some of
his work that he came to earth to do was to
show children how to treat their parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
One of the great laws of God is, “Children,
obey your parents.”</p>

<p>Jesus loved to be in the temple, but he
quickly and cheerfully went home with his
mother and Joseph. I think that as he
and his parents were with many of their
dear friends, he was allowed to go around
among them and with them when they went
to the temple, so when his parents left he
perhaps did not really know when his mother
started. Do you think she was careless
to go off and leave him? No, I am sure
she was not; she no doubt thought he was
coming along with his aunts or cousins or
his little friends in the company.</p>

<h2>Jesus in His Home.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">DO you like cold, dark, stormy days?
How do you feel when you get up and
find the sun shining in your window? You
cannot help feeling good—some of it gets
into your heart and makes you feel happy.
You make us think of sunny days. Sometimes
children are cross, and they make us
think of stormy days. The gloomy,
naughty, selfish child makes everything in
the house seem sad. But how about the
bright, happy, laughing, helpful child?
When he comes into the room, it seems as
if he brought some sunshine in. He is a
sunshiny boy.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/illus56.jpg" width="176" height="216" alt="big crowd of people, Jesus at front" />
</div>
<p>Do you know I am thinking of a boy who
I believe was the sunshiniest one among all
the sunshiny children in the world. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was he? He was Jesus, the dear boy who
was so ready to obey his parents. He
started home with Mary
and Joseph, perhaps
telling Joseph all about
how it happened that he
was left behind them.</p>



<p>After their long, hard
journey, how glad they
were to get home! I am
sure Jesus did all he
could to get everything
ready. First he helped Joseph bring in all
the things they had with them, and Mary
stood at the door of the little house, looking
at the boy she loved so much, and feeling
so glad and thankful that he had not really
been lost.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/illus57.jpg" width="173" height="204" alt="drawing Jesus working in shop with Joseph" />
</div>

<p>Then when they were all settled and
rested and Joseph had to go to his carpenter
work, Jesus would do such little things as
he could to help him, while Mary was doing
her work. Joseph was a carpenter. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
do you think he made? What tools did he
use? Then I think
Jesus must have learned
to use them, too. Perhaps
sometimes Mary
was sick, and then I am
sure he did all he could
to help and comfort her
and make her forget her
pain. He would bring
the jar of fresh water, bathe her head and
give her a cool drink. If your mamma
was sick, what could you do to be a blessing
to her? I knew a little boy who was a
real sunshine boy. When mamma was
sick he would set the table for papa, and
hand mamma a cup of tea, and give her a
smile and a loving kiss. We can all do so
much, and many other things. Think of
some of them. You can pick up your toys
and books and keep them tidy, without
waiting for mamma to talk about it; you
can always run to her with a loving kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
when you wake up and when you go to bed;
you can be very gentle and kind to your little
brothers and sisters; you can try every day
in every way to make sunshine in your
home—to make your home the most beautiful
place in the world. Boys and girls who
do that can make their homes next to
heaven.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/illus58.jpg" width="267" height="212" alt="drawing of painting at start of chapter" />
</div>

<p>Jesus did that even when he was very
small. As he
grew older he
grew wiser and
better. He
helped Joseph
more and more
in his shop, and
what he did not
know, Joseph
taught him.</p>

<p>He did not spend all his time in the shop.
He perhaps went to school, for he loved
to study. I think Mary loved to teach a
boy who was so ready to learn. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stand beside her while she read to him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/illus59.jpg" width="247" height="213" alt="Jesus reading scrolls at temple" />
</div>

<p>He liked to play like other boys, but he
always did the
things that other
children should
do, so they would
know just what
was right. That
is why I tell you
so much about
him. Perhaps
children would not know just the right way,
if Jesus had not been a boy and lived with
his mother and loved and obeyed and helped
her.</p>
